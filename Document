Step 1: Download the SARS-CoV-2 Sample
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR574/003/ERR5743893/ERR5743893_1.fastq.gz
wget -nc ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR574/003/ERR5743893/ERR5743893_2.fastq.gz
â€¢	Explanation: The wget command is used to download raw sequencing data in FASTQ format from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). The -nc flag ensures that files are not downloaded again if they already exist.
________________________________________
Step 2: Install FastQC
sudo apt-get install fastqc
â€¢	Explanation: FastQC is a tool for checking the quality of sequencing reads. This command installs FastQC if it's not already installed.
________________________________________
Step 3: Alternative Method â€“ Download Using fastq-dump
sudo apt-get install sra-toolkit
fastq-dump --split-files ERR5743893
â€¢	Explanation: The sra-toolkit provides an alternative way to download sequencing data directly from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The fastq-dump --split-files command retrieves paired-end reads.
________________________________________
Step 4: Download the Reference Genome
wget https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3?report=fasta -O MN908947.fa
â€¢	Explanation: This command downloads the reference genome (MN908947.3, the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 reference strain) from NCBI in FASTA format.
________________________________________

Step 5: Run Quality Check on FASTQ Files Using FastQC
fastqc ERR5743893_1.fastq.gz  
fastqc ERR5743893_2.fastq.gz  
â€¢	Explanation: Runs FastQC on both paired-end sequencing files to assess sequence quality, GC content, adapter contamination, and other quality metrics.
________________________________________
Step 6: Understand the FASTQ and FASTQC Reports
â€¢	FASTQ format: Contains raw sequencing reads and their quality scores.
â€¢	FASTQC report: Provides visual and statistical summaries of sequence quality, including per-base sequence quality and overrepresented sequences.
________________________________________
Step 7: Mapping (Create a Directory for Mapping)
mkdir Mapping
â€¢	Explanation: Creates a directory named Mapping where alignment results will be stored.
________________________________________
Step 8: Index the Reference Genome and Perform Alignment
bwa index MN908947.fasta
bwa mem MN908947.fasta ERR5743893_1.fastq ERR5743893_2.fastq > Mapping/ERR5743893.sam
â€¢	Explanation:
o	bwa index: Creates an index of the reference genome to allow efficient alignment.
o	bwa mem: Aligns the sequencing reads to the reference genome and outputs a Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) file.
cd Mapping
ls -lhrt
â€¢	Explanation: Navigates into the Mapping directory and lists the files in a human-readable format.
________________________________________

Step 9: Convert, Sort, and Index the Alignment
cd ..
samtools view -@ 20 -S -b Mapping/ERR5743893.sam > Mapping/ERR5743893.bam
â€¢	Explanation: Converts the SAM file into a BAM (binary alignment map) format using samtools view. The -@ 20 flag uses 20 CPU threads for faster processing.
samtools sort -@ 32 -o Mapping/ERR5743893.sorted.bam Mapping/ERR5743893.bam
â€¢	Explanation: Sorts the BAM file for efficient processing in downstream analyses.
samtools index Mapping/ERR5743893.sorted.bam
â€¢	Explanation: Indexes the sorted BAM file for fast access in visualization and variant calling.
________________________________________
Step 10: Visualization in IGV
â€¢	Explanation: The sorted BAM file can be loaded into Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) to visually inspect the read alignments and detect potential issues such as coverage gaps or misalignments.
________________________________________
Step 11: Index the Reference Genome
samtools faidx MN908947.fasta
â€¢	Explanation: Creates an index for the reference genome FASTA file to speed up querying specific genomic regions.
________________________________________





Step 12: Variant Analysis
freebayes -f MN908947.fasta Mapping/ERR5743893.sorted.bam > ERR5743893.vcf
â€¢	Explanation: Runs FreeBayes, a Bayesian variant caller, to identify SNPs and small indels in the sequencing data compared to the reference genome. The output is in Variant Call Format (VCF).
bgzip ERR5743893.vcf
tabix ERR5743893.vcf.gz
â€¢	Explanation:
o	bgzip: Compresses the VCF file.
o	tabix: Indexes the compressed VCF file for rapid querying.
________________________________________

â€¢	Download sequencing reads and reference genome
â€¢	Perform quality control
â€¢	Align reads to the reference genome
â€¢	Sort and index the alignments
â€¢	Visualize the mapping results in IGV
â€¢	Call genetic variants from the sequencing data
